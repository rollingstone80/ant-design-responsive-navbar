I always thought that a responsive navigation bar was a key missing feature in Ant Design.

In this simple example, the top menu collapses at a 768px viewport into a menu button with extensible drawer for use on smaller screens.

For use:
1) git clone https://github.com/rollingstone80/ant-design-responsive-navbar.git
2) yarn install
3) yarn start
